Binary search is an algorithm.

It's input is a sorted list of elements.

With binary search, you remove half of the input data-set upon each iteration.

For any list of _n_ elements, binary search will take log2(n) steps to run in the worst case scenario.

Logarithms:

log10(100) is effectively asking, how many tens do we have to multiply to get 100. The answer is 2, therefore log10(100) = 2, because 10(1) * 10(2) = 100.

Logs are the inversion of exponents.
